    <h2>Haggis</h2>
    <p class="info">In the past, people used as much of a slain animal as possible. 
        Internal organs were harder to preserve for a long time.
        So the animal's stomach was used as a convenient natural casing,
         which could be used to cook on the spot.</p>

    <h3>Traditional components of haggis</h3>
        <ul>
            <li class="info">Chopped or minced 'pluck' of a sheep (heart, liver and lungs)</li>
            <li class="info">Coarse oatmeal</li>
            <li class="info">Suet</li>
            <li class="info">Spices (nutmeg, cinnamon and coriander are common)</li>
            <li class="info">Salt and pepper</li>
            <li class="info">Stock</li>
            <li class="info">This mixture is stuffed into a casing (nowadays sometimes synthetic rather than a stomach)</li>
        </ul>
