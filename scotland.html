    <h3>Haggis</h3>
    <p>The national dish of Scotland is made of:</p>
    <p>In the past, people used as much of a slain animal as possible. 
        Internal organs were harder to preserve for a long time.
        So the animal's stomach was used as a convenient natural casing,
         which could be used to cook on the spot.</p>

    <h4>Traditional components of haggis</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Chopped or minced 'pluck' of a sheep (heart, liver and lungs)</li>
        <li>Coarse oatmeal</li>
        <li>Suet</li>
        <li>Spices (nutmeg, cinnamon and coriander are common)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Stock</li>
        <li>This mixture is stuffed into a casing (nowadays sometimes synthetic rather than a stomach)</li>
    </ul>
